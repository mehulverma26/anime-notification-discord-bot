# Anime Notification Discord Bot

This is an Anime Discord bot that is built using the disnake library and it's using the Anilist, MyAnimeListAPI, JikanAPI libraries. It allows you to track anime airing episodes and notified when a new episode releases, or keep track of the anime you are watching, and displays how long it will take a new episode to come out.




### Features
  
- Notifies on Discord when the next episode of an anime airs
- Ability to track multiple anime
- Lists information about every anime's airing time/how long for the next episode to come out.
- Gives you the link to watch the episode right from discord.
- Easy to use

### Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests and raise issues on the Github page.

Note:

- the bot is designed to be run 24/7 in order to scrape every so often, so if you don't have a dedicated server, you can use [replit](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/build-basic-discord-bot-python#creating-a-repl-and-installing-our-discord-dependencies) (However, you will need to put your tokens from the .env file into replit Secrets, and upload each file onto the replit repository.
- the bot is using scraping to get anime episode airing information, so if any issues with the scraping please let me know.
- feel free to modify and use the code according to your usecase.
